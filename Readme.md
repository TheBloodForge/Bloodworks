# Bloodworks [WIP]
### A minecraft mod about making blood work

Bloodworks is a mod that strives to be less edgy than other "blood mods."
It uses a more pseudo-scientific approach, where the end goal is to construct what is effectively
a giant functional body within your base, complete with organs for
resource processing and the like. The concept is pretty loose currently, as
the mod is still under active development. This is the core idea though.
